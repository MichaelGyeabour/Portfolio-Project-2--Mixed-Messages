            <h2>The Decision-Making Pendulum</h2>
            <p> 
One of the struggles organizations face is getting lost in the decision-making process. Many leaders either use a lot of authority or seek consensus. More often than not, they stick to one decision-making style for everything. Conflicts happen, hearts get broken, frustrations come from every direction, resulting in resignations. The inflexibility in decision-making is at the root of various problems.

When I wrote about having a bias for action, I talked about different sizes of decisions. I specifically didn't say anything about the effective decision-making process. Creating a bias towards action requires having a flexible but solid decision-making process. Especially leader's pendulum between going with action vs. contemplation demands to have different decision-making styles.

In our conversation with David Marquet, he mentioned that authority is detrimental to everyone; leader, employees, and the organization. When leaders give commands in every decision, they include themselves everywhere while preventing others from growing. When they are involved in everything, they become blockers. The amount of authority and hierarchy affect the timeline of the projects. Therefore, it's not sustainable for anyone.

On the other hand, there is consensus decision-making: convincing everyone and agreeing together. When the leaders use consensus in decisions, the processes take a long time. Getting an "I agree" message from everyone is not easy to do and, again, affects the timeline of the projects.

Now, you might say, "Well, we are left with just giving advice and consent decision-making." Consent decision-making means not having any objections. Instead of getting an "I agree" message from everyone, you propose and look for qualifying objections. "Disagree and commit" is part of this style. The goal is reaching "good enough" or "safe to try" decisions.
This style looks more promising and suitable for many situations. However, the more robust strategy is that having the flexibility to use all of the above together.
